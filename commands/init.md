# git init

the `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.

if you want to make a new directory and init a git repository, you can use the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

once in the git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md)
[add](./add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
