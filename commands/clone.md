# git clone

cloning a repository is creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repository. It will be a clone, meaning it has all tracked comments and commit history

It will also be associated with the remote, mening you can use the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original repository

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:

```
git clone https://github.com/ELEVENFIFTYACADEMY/TerminalDungeon.git
```
